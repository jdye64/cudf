# RAPIDS AI JavaCPP Native Bindings

## Building
A `build.sh` has been provided. Simply running `build.sh` as long as all your environment pre-reqs are met should 
build the native Java bindings for CUDF.

## Using Native Bindings
The result of this project is a single .jar file that contains both the JNI autogenerated code and the shared objects for 
the target platform and architecture. Although currently only Ubuntu is supported. Simply import the jar and use in 
your project like you would any other Java library.

## Notes
- Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with OpenJDK 11 installed
- Requires that a conda environment named `cudf_dev` is present and contains the c++ headers and libs you want to link against.
- Thrust is currently expected to be present on the standard include directory, this needs to change
- Currently only Thrust 1.10.0 is supported, if you don't use this version you will encounter an error. This will be taken
care of later in the soon to come `cppbuild.sh` script that will prepare your environment for you as part of the 
  `mvn compile` phase of the Maven lifecycle.

## TODO
- Make Maven plugin to ensure that building of generated java files occur
- Create `cppbuild.sh` file that pulls down the latest cudf source code so users don't have to have a conda environment present
- Make it so that Thrust does not have to be manually installed before the build can occur. Simply doing this for now
so I don't have to slow down forward progress.
